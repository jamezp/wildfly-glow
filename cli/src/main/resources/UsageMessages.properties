wildfly-glow.usage.footer = %nUse @|fg(yellow) wildfly-glow <command> --help|@ to show help information for the command.

batch = Batch mode disables any colorization of the output.
cloud = When deploying your application to the cloud. It will fine tune the WildFly server for the cloud. N.B.: Building a Bootable JAR is not supported for the cloud.
exclude-archives-from-scan = Comma-separated list of archives to exclude from scanning. Wildcards ('*') are allowed. N.B. Just the name of the archive is matched, do not attempt to specify a full path within the jar. The following example would be a valid list: @|fg(italic) my-jar.jar,*-internal.rar|@:
docker-image-name = Name of the docker image when --provision=DOCKER is specified. By default an image name is computed based on the WildFly server version.
version = Prints the version of wildfly-glow and exits.
verbose = Prints additional information. When scanning a deployment, the set of rules that selected a Galleon layer are printed. Enable verbose if the command fails in order to get details.
server-version = The WildFly server version to deploy the deployment to. By default the latest WildFly version is used.
wildfly-preview = To deploy the deployment into a WildFly preview server (by default normal WildFly server is used).
ha = High Availability profile. Set this option when deploying an application into an HA WildFly Server.
add-layers-for-jndi = List of layers. In the case some layers are missing, consider adding them manually with this option.
suggest = WildFly Glow will suggest additional add-ons and environment variables that are usable with your deployment.
add-ons = List of add-ons to enable. To get the list of possible add-ons, use the @|fg(yellow) show-add-ons|@ command.
deployments = List of path to war|jar|ear files to scan.
input-feature-packs-file = Galleon feature-packs used by wildfly-glow are retrieved from an online registry. To override the set of feature-packs you can specify a path to a Galleon provisioning XML file containing the set of Galleon feature-packs to be used by wildfly-glow.
provision = The kind of provisioning to produce based on what has been discovered. Can be @|fg(yellow) SERVER|@: a provisioned WildFly server, @|fg(yellow) BOOTABLE_JAR|@: a WildFly Bootable JAR, @|fg(yellow) DOCKER_IMAGE|@: a Docker image, @|fg(yellow) OPENSHIFT|@: a server built and deploy on OpenShift, you must be logged to a cluster, or @|fg(yellow) PROVISIONING_XML|@: a Galleon provisioning.xml file.
output-dir = If specifying to provision, the directory where the result will be output.
wildfly-preview = Use only WildFly preview feature-packs as input.
stability-level = Specify a stability to be used when provisioning a server. The stability is also used to identify server features that would be not enabled by the specified stability. The stability is by default the minimum stability of each Galleon feature-packs. The stability can be @|fg(yellow) default|@, @|fg(yellow) community|@, @|fg(yellow) preview|@, @|fg(yellow) experimental|@.
env-file = The path to a file that contains environment variables (in the form env=value) to be passed to the OpenShift deployment. Can only be used with @|fg(yellow) OPENSHIFT|@ kind of provisioning.
disable-deployers = A comma separated list of deployer names to disable. To retrieve all the deployer names call the @|fg(yellow) show-configuration|@ operation. To disable them all, use @|fg(yellow) ALL|@ value. Can only be used with @|fg(yellow) OPENSHIFT|@ kind of provisioning.
