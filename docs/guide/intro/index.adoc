## Introduction

WildFly Glow is an evolution of the WildFly link:https://docs.wildfly.org/galleon/[Galleon] provisioning tooling. 

The goal of this project is to offer tooling allowing to identify the set of Galleon Feature-packs and Layers that are required 
by your application. The entry-point of this discovery is your application.

### Automatic identification of WildFly Galleon Layers

Today, in order to trim a WildFly server to fit the application requirements, you have to first identify the 
set of WildFly Galleon link:https://docs.wildfly.org/30/Galleon_Guide.html#wildfly_galleon_layers[Layers] to use.

WildFly Glow identifies the Layers for you by scanning your application war (jar or ear) files. 

This application to Galleon Layers mapping is based on rules contained in WildFly Galleon Layers (Starting WildFly 29). 
These rules express the Java types and artifacts (XML descriptors, properties files, ...) 
that are bound to the usage of a given Galleon Layer. An example of rule can be found in the link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/blob/30.0.0.Final/ee-feature-pack/galleon-shared/src/main/resources/layers/standalone/jaxrs/layer-spec.xml#L8[jaxrs] Layer.

Once the Layers are identified, the Galleon Feature-packs that define them are selected and included.

### Centralized knowledge of WildFly Galleon Feature-packs.

WildFly can be extended with additional Galleon Feature-packs (e.g.: datasources, gRPC, keycloak, cloud, myfaces, resteasy-spring, ...).

WildFly Glow has, per WildFly version, the knowledge of some compatible Galleon Feature-packs (this information is stored in 
link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-galleon-feature-packs/tree/release[this] github project).

In order for these extras Feature-packs to be recognized by WildFly Glow, they must have their defined Layers annotated with rules.

### Incubating feature-packs.

Feature-packs that are developed outside of the WildFly feature process can be registered in the "incubating" space. 
This space can be explicitly enabled when discovering provisioning configuration.
WildFly Glow has, per WildFly version, the knowledge of 'incubating' compatible Galleon Feature-packs (this information is stored in 
link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-galleon-feature-packs/tree/main/spaces/incubating[this] directory).

In order for these extras feature-packs to be recognized by WildFly Glow, they must have their defined Layers annotated with rules.

### Going beyond discovered Galleon Layers

WildFly Glow does more than identifying Galleon Feature-packs and Layers.

#### Provisioning

WildFly Glow CLI allows you to provision a WildFly server, a WildFly Bootable JAR, produce a Docker image and deploy your application to OpenShift.

##### OpenShift provisioning

A good way to start with OpenShift is by using the link:https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox[OpenShift Sandbox]. 
You can create a cluster in few clicks.

###### Pre-requisites

Once you have a custer up and running, there are few steps needed in order for WildFly Glow to log onto the cluster:

* Download the `oc` command from your cluster. Click on the `?` icon on the top right corner of the OpenShift admin console, then select `Command Line Tools`, 
then download `oc` for your platform.
* Retrieve the command to log to the Cluster. Click on your user name on the top right corner, 
then select `Copy login command`. This will open a page, copy the login command.
That should be something like: `oc login --token=sha256~ITC16QZxiVk5vm7NCdrRIx2yqvlB-L_6Wg-BrtIhnLE --server=https://api.sandbox-m3.1530.p1.openshiftapps.com:6443`

* Paste the login command in your terminal.

WildFly Glow can now interact with your cluster.

###### Deploying to OpenShift

That is done from the `wildfly-glow` command line tool. You can specify `--cloud --provision OPENSHIFT` to the `scan` command. For example:

`wildfly-glow scan examples/kitchensink.war --cloud --provision OPENSHIFT`

The kitchensink war file is analyzed, the Galleon configuration is generated, then both the war and the configuration are sent to OpenShift to start a server 
provisioning and create your application deployment.

At the end of the build, the application is deployed and the route to your application inside the cluster is printed. 
Use it to interact with your application.

Note: The OpenShift resources yaml files are generated in the directory `server-<wildfly version>/resources`

Note: the support for OpenShift is currently specified by this WildFly Glow project link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-glow/issues/49[GitHub Issue].

###### Automatic deployment of PostGreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, AMQ JMS Broker and Keycloak

If WildFly Glow detects the need for these technologies, it will automatically deploy the required servers and will bound the application to them.

###### High Availability support

When the HA profile is enabled, 2 pods will be created for the deployment. 
The JGroups `dns.DNS_PING` protocol is enabled for the members of the cluster to discover each others.

#### OpenShift dry-run mode

When using the `--dry-run` option, WildFly glow will not interact with the cluster but will generate all the needed resources that are required to build 
and deploy your application in the cluster of your choice. You can then assemble the images and deploy to your cluster in a flexible way. 
The generated resources allow, for example, to setup a link:https://tekton.dev/[Tekton] pipeline to produce images, 
and use link:https://argoproj.github.io/cd/[Argo CD] to manage your k8s resources.

##### Docker files for the server and application images

WildFly Glow separates the build of your application image into 2 steps. A first step to build the server image that only contains the WildFly server.
A second step that, from the server image, produces an application image that contains the deployments, the WildFly CLI script (if any) and the bash initialization script (if any).

In order to share the server image between various applications, a server image tag is computed based on all that makes the content of the server unique:

* The generated provisioning XML file
* Env variables (if any) used at provisioning time.
* WildFly channel (if any) used at provisioning time.

###### Bulding and pushing the server image

Once WildFly Glow has generated the resources, you need to:

* Provision the server using the generated `<server-version>/galleon/provisioning.xml` file (using Galleon CLI) inside the directory `<server-version>/docker/server/server`.
* Build and push the server image using the server tag generated in `<server-version>/docker/image.properties` and the docker file `<server-version>/docker/server/Dockerfile`.
Makes sure to run the build inside the directory `<server-version>/docker/server`, that is the expected build docker context.

###### Bulding and pushing the application image

Once you have pushed the server in a container image repository, you need to:

* In the `<server-version>/docker/app/Dockerfile` file replace the `WILDFLY_GLOW_SERVER_IMAGE_REPOSITORY` placeholder with the pushed server image repository.
* Build and push the application image using the application tag generated in `<server-version>/docker/image.properties` and the docker file `<server-version>/docker/app/Dockerfile`.
Makes sure to run the build inside the directory `<server-version>/docker/app`, that is the expected build docker context.

##### Updating the k8s deployment with the generated application image

The generated deployment (or the statefulSet in case of HA application) in `<server-version>/resources/deployment/` directory references the container image using the placeholder `WILDFLY_GLOW_APP_IMAGE_REPOSITORY`. Replaces it 
with the actual application image repository.

You are good to go. You can now create the k8s resources in your cluster.

#### WildFly additional features discovery

Some WildFly server features can't be discovered by scanning application deployment. A good example is the usage of SSL to secure the http 
access. Another one is the need for WildFly tooling (e,g,: WildFly CLI, elytron tooling, ...). 
WildFly Glow allows you to include, according to what has been discovered in the deployment, a set of WildFly features called `add-ons` that makes sense 
for your application.

#### Connection to databases

WildFly Glow detects that your application requires a datasource and will suggest you with database `add-ons` to be included in order   
to connect to the DB of your choice (postgresql, mysql, ...).


### WildFly Glow tooling

WildFly Glow tooling is composed of 3 parts:

* A Command Line interface (`wildfly-glow` CLI) that scan your deployment and can provision a WildFly server, a WildFly Bootable JAR and 
a Docker image (to be deployed on Kubernetes). From the CLI you can discover the list of available `add-ons`, the list of WildFly server versions 
you can use (the latest WildFly major release being the default).

* An integration with the WildFly Maven plugin (Starting 5.0.0.Alpha2) `package` goal, to provision a WildFly server without specifying 
Feature-packs and Layers.

* A Maven plugin to scan Arquillian deployments in your tests and produce a `provisioning.xml` file that can be consumed by WildFly provisioning tooling.

### Support for WildFly Stability

WildFly Glow CLI has a support 
for link:http://docs.wildfly.org/32/Admin_Guide.html#Feature_stability_levels[WildFly Stability].

WildFly Glow can detect and report that some of the discovered Galleon layers contain 
content that are only available at a given stability and advise you to enable this stability level 
(by using the `--config-stability-level=<stability level>` option.

When provisioning a server, if a stability level has been specified, WildFly Glow will display how 
a WildFly server must be started to enable the stability level. For example: `standalone.sh --stability=preview`

When provisioning for OpenShift, if a stability level has been specified, WildFly Glow will configure the generated OpenShift Deployment 
to start the server with the required stability level.

To list the options related to the WildFly stability feature, call `wildfly-glow scan --help` and look for `--*stability-level` options.
