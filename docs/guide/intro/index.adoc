## Introduction

WildFly Glow is an evolution of the WildFly link:https://docs.wildfly.org/galleon/[Galleon] provisioning tooling. 

The goal of this project is to offer tooling allowing to identify the set of Galleon feature-packs and layers that are required 
by your application. The entry-point of this discovery is your application.

### Automatic identification of WildFly Galleon layers

Today, in order to trim a WildFly server to fit the application requirements, you have to first identify the 
set of WildFly Galleon link:https://docs.wildfly.org/30/Galleon_Guide.html#wildfly_galleon_layers[layers] to use.

WildFly Glow identifies the layers for you by scanning your application war (jar or ear) files. 

This application to Galleon layers mapping is based on rules contained in WildFly Galleon layers (Starting WildFly 29). 
These rules express the Java types and artifacts (XML descriptors, properties files, ...) 
that are bound to the usage of a given Galleon layer. An example of rule can be found in the link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/blob/30.0.0.Final/ee-feature-pack/galleon-shared/src/main/resources/layers/standalone/jaxrs/layer-spec.xml#L8[jaxrs] layer.

Once the layers are identified, the Galleon feature-packs that define them are selected and included.

### Centralized knowledge of WildFly Galleon feature-packs.

WildFly can be extended with additional Galleon feature-packs (e.g.: datasources, gRPC, keycloak, cloud, myfaces, resteasy-spring, ...).

WildFly Glow has, per WildFly version, the knowledge of some compatible Galleon feature-packs (this information is stored in 
link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-galleon-feature-packs/tree/release[this] github project).

In order for these extras feature-packs to be recognized by WildFly Glow, they must have their defined layers annotated with rules.

### Going beyond discovered Galleon layers

WildFly Glow does more than identifying Galleon feature-packs and layers.

#### Provisioning

WildFly Glow tooling allows you to provision WildFly server, WildFly Bootable JAR or produce a Docker image.

#### WildFly additional features discovery

Some WildFly server features can't be discovered by scanning application deployment. A good example is the usage of SSL to secure the http 
access. Another one is the need for WildFly tooling (e,g,: WildFly CLI, elytron tooling, ...). 
WildFly Glow allows you to include, according to what has been discovered in the deployment, a set of WildFly features called `add-ons` that makes sense 
for your application.

#### Connection to databases

WildFly Glow detects that your application requires a datasource and will suggest you with database `add-ons` to be included in order   
to connect to the DB of your choice (postgresql, mysql, ...).


### WildFly Glow tooling

WildFly Glow tooling is composed of 2 main parts:

* A Command Line interface (`wildfly-glow` CLI) that scan your deployment and can provision a WildFly server, a WildFly Bootable JAR and 
a Docker image (to be deployed on Kubernetes). From the CLI you can discover the list of available `add-ons`, the list of WildFly server versions 
you can use (the latest WildFly major release being the default).

* An integration with the WildFly Maven plugin (Starting 5.0.0.Alpha2) `package` goal, to provision a WildFly server without specifying 
feature-packs and layers.

* A Maven plugin to scan Arquillian deployments in your tests.
