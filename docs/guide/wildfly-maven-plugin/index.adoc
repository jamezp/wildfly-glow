## WildFly Maven Plugin integration

WildFly Glow has been integrated in WildFly Maven Plugin `5.x` starting with `5.0.0.Alpha2` version.

When using version 4.2 of the link:http://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-maven-plugin[WildFly Maven Plugin] 
you must specify the WildFly Galleon Feature-packs and Galleon Layers to use to provision WIldFly. 
For example, a plugin configuration extract to provision WildFly for cloud with support to connect to `postgresql` database.

        </feature-packs>
        <layers>
            <layer>jaxrs-server</layer>
            <layer>postgresql-datasource</layer>
        </layers>
        <runtime-name>ROOT.war</runtime-name>
    </configuration>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>package</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
----

The set of Feature-packs versions that are compatible with WildFly and the set of Galleon Layers that are required to properly execute your application 
must be known and added to the configuration. This does create some complexity.

The integration of WildFly Glow in the WildFly Maven plugin allows to delegate to the plugin the provisioning configuration. The plugin scans your deployment 
and provision a server based on what has been discovered.

The plugin configuration becomes:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.wildfly.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>wildfly-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>5.0.0.Beta1</version>
    <configuration>
        <discover-provisioning-info/>
        <runtime-name>ROOT.war</runtime-name>
    </configuration>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>package</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
----

When executing the plugin with such configuration, the set of discovered Feature-packs and Layers are used to provision the WildFly server. 
In addition, provisioning information is displayed and the file 
`target/glow-scan/provisioning.xml` is generated. This allows you to see what the plugin has discovered 
and that it is in line with what you are expecting.

### Specifying a WildFly version

By default the latest WildFly version is used, you can specify a given WildFly version (starting with WildFly 29.0.0.Final). To do so extend 
the `discover-provisioning-info` element:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<discover-provisioning-info>
    <version>30.0.0.Final</version>
</discover-provisioning-info>
----

### Adding add-ons

If your application requires some additional features not discovered in your deployment, you can specify add-ons:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<discover-provisioning-info>
    <add-ons>
        <add-on>ssl</add-on>
        <add-on>openapi</add-on>
    </add-ons>
</discover-provisioning-info>
----

According to what has been discovered in your deployment, the plugin can suggest a set of add-ons that would make sense for your application. 
You should see the following message being displayed:

----
Some suggestions have been found. You could enable suggestions with --suggest option (if using the WildFly Glow CLI) or <suggest>true</suggest> (if using the WildFly Maven Plugin).
----

To print the suggestions, evolve the `discover-provisioning-info`:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<discover-provisioning-info>
    <suggest>true</suggest>
</discover-provisioning-info>
----

Note: In order to find-out the set of possible add-ons you could add, you could also use 
the WildFly Glow CLI command line that offers a command to list the available add-ons for a given WildFly version.

### Configuring add-ons

It can happen that the added add-on(s) require some environment variables to be set at server execution time. The plugin 
will display the set of expected environment variables (and values) that you should set when starting the server. 
For example, when adding the `postgresql` add-on, the following warning is displayed:

----
strongly suggested configuration
postgresql-datasource:
 - POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=Defines the database name to be used in the datasourceâ€™s `connection-url` property.
 - POSTGRESQL_JNDI=java:jboss/datasources/PostgreSQLDS
 - POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=Defines the password for the datasource.
 - POSTGRESQL_USER=Defines the username for the datasource.
----
 
### Specifying the cloud execution context

If the application you are building targets a cloud execution extend the `discover-provisioning-info` element:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<discover-provisioning-info>
    <context>cloud</context>
</discover-provisioning-info>
----

When cloud is enabled, some extra Galleon Feature-packs and Galleon Layers will be added to provision 
a WildFly server that properly executes on OpenShift or Kubernetes.

### HA (High Availability) support

High availability support implies that some Galleon Layers are included and some are excluded in order to provision a valid HA 
server.

For example, to provision an HA server to run distributed ejb, when using WildFly Maven Plugin 4.2, you would have to specify:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<layers>
    <layer>jaxrs-server</layer>
    <layer>ejb-lite</layer>
    <layer>ejb-dist-cache</layer>
</layers>
<excluded-layers>
    <layer>ejb-local-cache</layer>
</excluded-layers>
----

In this example, the local ejb infinispan cache is excluded and the ejb infinispan distributed one is added.

WildFly Glow handles that for you, simply evolve the `discover-provisioning-info` element with the `ha` profile:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<discover-provisioning-info>
    <profile>ha</profile>
</discover-provisioning-info>
----

The Galleon Layers inclusions and exclusions are automatically handled.

### Dry-run

You can configure the plugin to just scan the deployment and not provision a server:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<discover-provisioning-info></discover-provisioning-info>
<dry-run>true</dry-run>
----

### Error handling

Some errors can be discovered by the plugin during deployment scanning. For example an `add-on` is required and must be added. 
If some errors are found the plugin execution is aborted and you need to take an action (e.g.: add the missing `add-on`). 
In some cases, it can appear that the error is actually not problematic and can be ignored, to do so, evolve the `discover-provisioning-info`:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<discover-provisioning-info>
    <failsOnError>false</failsOnError>
</discover-provisioning-info>
----

### Support for WildFly Preview

If you are targeting deployment to the WildFly Preview server, evolve the `discover-provisioning-info`:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<discover-provisioning-info>
    <preview>true</preview>
</discover-provisioning-info>
----

### Specifying additional Galleon Layers

In case your application is requiring some extras Galleon Layers due to the fact that some API usages are hidden in your implementation (e.g.: 
Java reflection, usage of JNDI API), you can evolve the `discover-provisioning-info`:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<discover-provisioning-info>
    <layersForJndi>
        <layer>mail</layer>
    </layersForJndi>
</discover-provisioning-info>
----

In this example, the `mail` Galleon Layer is added.
